00:01.500 --> 00:04.860
In this video I'm going to demonstrate the tips and tricks I've shared with you.

00:05.640 --> 00:10.590
First, I'll show you how I use my "Project Working Doc" when collaborating with SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) to build a Rise course.

00:11.340 --> 00:17.060
I use the heading functionality in Google docs to correspond to the blocks of content in my Rise course.

00:17.920 --> 00:23.450
In my doc, I have a single Heading 1 topic corresponding to the title of my Project Working Doc.

00:24.140 --> 00:26.270
Everything else is a Heading 2 or less.

00:27.040 --> 00:32.460
The reason why I have a singular Heading 1 in my Google docs is to meet accessibility requirements.

00:32.910 --> 00:41.260
Screen readers require one and only one Heading 1 element in any DOM or Document Object Model structure to work properly.

00:41.260 --> 00:49.370
For this project, I was collaborating with SMEs that use screen readers. Practice tip: It's important for any job aids that you create using Google

00:49.370 --> 00:55.650
docs that you have exactly one Heading 1 element in your document to make your job aid accessible.

00:55.650 --> 01:01.830
In my doc, I include a number of links for quick references, including a link to the corresponding 

01:01.830 --> 01:09.870
Review 360 link for the course. And, I add the published details and Workday Learning link when the project is completed for future reference.

01:11.840 --> 01:20.210
Most of my courses start with a Course Overview lesson. This is denoted with a Heading 2 style in my Project Working Doc to make it easy to read

01:20.290 --> 01:28.710
and provide accessible navigation. When I work with SMEs, I encourage them to make edits using the suggestions or comment feature of Google docs.

01:29.140 --> 01:35.660
For example, if the SME wanted to delete this content - the SME would change the mode from Editing to Suggesting,

01:36.240 --> 01:39.750
delete the content, and optionally add a comment about their change for me.

01:40.640 --> 01:48.640
As I make the change in the Rise content, I accept the suggestions in Google docs and the content stays aligned between Rise and my project.

01:48.640 --> 01:49.250
working doc.

01:50.600 --> 01:55.460
Now I'll show you how the content and the Project Working Doc matches content in a completed Rise course.

01:56.540 --> 02:05.390
First let's find my accessibility for PMs (Product Managers) course. I have a lot of different folders in my Rise account to organize my projects. 

02:05.400 --> 02:13.660
Rise automatically keeps your content and the All Courses folder sorted by recent update date as the default, or you can sort by course name.

02:14.430 --> 02:19.570
Since I have so many projects, I find this difficult and cumbersome.

02:19.660 --> 02:22.150
Practice Tip: Use Rise folders to organize your content.

02:23.440 --> 02:29.020
I use a zero 0GN Drafts - In Progress folder to store my currently active projects.

02:29.290 --> 02:36.540
The zero makes it appear first in the list of the project folders. The Accessibility for PM's project is already completed,

02:36.710 --> 02:44.040
so I have moved it into my Dev Ed - Primary Source Files folder. Since everything is sorted by date and it's the last project I published,

02:44.050 --> 02:49.760
it'll be at the top of this folder. Okay, so let's review the content and the Rise course for this project.

02:50.740 --> 02:59.030
My courses typically have a large - what I call a Catalog Overview page. This information is copied into Workday Learning by our learning administrators

02:59.030 --> 03:04.250
before publication. Here you see my first Rise lesson called Course Overview.

03:05.040 --> 03:13.810
The simple content in this lesson matches the content in my Project Working Doc. As you can see, the Text Blocks and a Quote Block in Rise correspond

03:13.830 --> 03:15.860
to the labeled content in my doc.

03:18.740 --> 03:21.560
I state the learning objectives using a Numbered List.

03:23.240 --> 03:29.450
Rise Checkbox Lists are NOT accessible - so avoid using them. Now let's look at a more complicated lesson.

03:30.240 --> 03:35.980
The Applying the Definition of Done lesson has a lot of content in it organized by Best Practice Tips.

03:36.540 --> 03:41.740
This content is built with paragraphs heading, a video, a labeled graphic

03:41.750 --> 03:42.360
and more.

03:44.940 --> 03:53.010
Specifically, let's look at the content called "A cautionary tale" that was built using a Labeled Graphic Block and a custom SVG graphic

03:53.010 --> 03:53.990
from Google slides.

03:54.740 --> 04:02.740
It starts with some paragraph content. Then the Annotated image Labeled Graphic Block has instructions and the image

04:02.740 --> 04:04.260
name with alt text.

04:05.120 --> 04:13.680
It's important to make your labeled graphics accessible for all users. Rise uses the HTML label "markers" to describe the annotation

04:13.680 --> 04:21.780
label interactions in the DOM. So be sure to use the word markers in your instructions to help users using screen readers

04:21.780 --> 04:30.350
navigate your labeled graphic. Additionally add a number image to each marker and/or make the text on the annotation correspond

04:30.350 --> 04:37.160
to the image item it's labeling. In my project doc I've used headings to distinguish between the different markers and content.

04:37.740 --> 04:44.760
So for example the marker "I" Spoiler Alert heading in my doc corresponds to the label with the "i" icon in Rise.

04:45.530 --> 04:52.940
The other markers have number icons added to help with accessibility navigation on the graphic. As the SMEs and I collaborated on this image,

04:53.250 --> 04:59.310
we use the comment and suggestions feature to make many changes. In fact, the image you see here is not the original image

04:59.310 --> 05:00.160
we started with!

05:01.040 --> 05:06.100
Reviewing the comment feature of the Google doc you can view the history of when and why those changes were made.

05:06.940 --> 05:11.170
For custom images used in this course and in others, I use Google slides.

05:11.940 --> 05:17.850
For each project, I create a Google slide deck reusing Workday Brand Template slides whenever possible.

05:18.740 --> 05:23.060
Here you can see the Google slide I used to create the labeled graphic image used in Rise.

05:24.140 --> 05:32.040
I made sure to leave extra spaces on my buttons to have a nice background contrast color for the marker annotations. To add the image to Rise,

05:32.050 --> 05:40.460
select your slide. Then select File > Download SVG option to have a clear scalable image to view for any device.

05:41.140 --> 05:49.360
The file will automatically be named with your slide deck title. This is obnoxious as I continually have to rename the image to be something meaningful.

05:50.340 --> 05:56.990
When you rename your image, be sure to keep the required alt text accessibility naming requirements in mind.

05:57.020 --> 06:05.590
So for example, this image might be named "worker with tangled wires on a computer". Generally I do not open my SVG file and I recommend

06:05.590 --> 06:08.550
that you don't open it either unless you have Adobe Illustrator.

06:09.640 --> 06:14.260
Upload the SVG into your Rise Labeled Graphic Block directly from your Downloads folder.

06:15.240 --> 06:23.340
Since most SMEs do not have Adobe Illustrator, I typically also download a PNG version of the image to share in docs, Slack or other

06:23.340 --> 06:24.860
ways as needed for feedback.

06:25.940 --> 06:34.350
Here's an example of an image used by modifying a Workday Brand Template slide to illustrate personas and another custom image created by the SMEs

06:34.360 --> 06:41.130
about contrast ratios. When I have videos In my course, I always create the script for the video and a separate Google doc.

06:41.390 --> 06:49.740
I collaborate with the SMEs to make sure the wording is just right and add a link to the video script in my Project Working Doc. I use the comments

06:49.740 --> 06:55.500
to remind myself to create the VTT files for closed captions and upload them to Rise before publication.

06:56.540 --> 07:02.860
The video script doc is super helpful when proofreading the VTT files for spellings, punctuation and capitalizations.

07:03.530 --> 07:09.120
Most courses I create have a Knowledge Check required for completion credit. I use Google docs to organize,

07:09.130 --> 07:17.200
edit, and maintain the questions. Specifically, I use Google doc headings and a table of contents to have easy links to edit the various parts of

07:17.210 --> 07:25.200
my questions. When you are adding Knowledge Check questions in Rise, you enter them in a certain order. This authored order is how I number and label the questions

07:25.200 --> 07:33.250
in my doc. Typically I use the Unlimited Quiz, Randomize Question Order, and Shuffle Answer Choice settings for the learners

07:33.250 --> 07:41.250
in Rise for Knowledge Check lessons. This presents a challenge when trying to track user feedback after publication about questions that may have errors or need to

07:41.250 --> 07:49.670
be modified. The numbering helps me and others keep track of what the content is. Something I learned while creating the accessibility for PM's course

07:49.770 --> 07:54.950
is only the Rise Knowledge Check multiple choice question type is accessible.

07:55.940 --> 08:02.210
Previously I had used matching and check all that apply multiple response questions in my Knowledge Checks for other courses.

08:03.440 --> 08:11.260
To make accessible versions of these types of questions for the course, I wrote all the questions as multiple choice types with a few creative twists.

08:11.940 --> 08:16.860
For example in Question 1 - Workday Success. It's a true simple true or false question.

08:17.630 --> 08:24.590
The answer choice of green indicates what is correct in my project doc and the feedback matches what you see in the Rise feedback option.

08:26.340 --> 08:34.050
Question 2 -  Accessibility Requirements I would typically have written as a multiple response check all that apply type of question.

08:35.240 --> 08:43.240
To make the question accessible, I list many true choices and write the instructions of the question to ask which of the following is NOT considered a

08:43.240 --> 08:50.690
requirement. I have found having a Knowledge Check doc is really helpful when asking others to quickly test your course and for maintenance going forward.

08:51.640 --> 08:59.780
Here's an example of a course template I have shared with my PTLE team. I typically denote everything in red and use TBD to denote content

08:59.790 --> 09:00.750
I need to change.

09:01.740 --> 09:09.740
Here you can see how the Catalog Overview template was used in the Accessibility for PMs course. The red/TBD content has been updated for our learning

09:09.740 --> 09:12.710
admins to use when publishing the course to Workday Learning.

09:13.840 --> 09:21.250
In the template itself, there are sample lessons. First, there is a Sample Course Overview lesson with the template.

09:21.640 --> 09:27.910
It's a sample example with a quote and a placeholder. Here you can see how that template was used in my Rise course.

09:30.040 --> 09:38.140
I have two different types of content lesson samples. The first one is a general content sample with actual content in it

09:38.140 --> 09:43.660
about Workday. It's all about the customer journey and tenants - something everyone at Workday should know.

09:44.140 --> 09:50.460
It illustrates the flow of content, including a video and accordion interactions as a sample to edit with your own content.

09:51.440 --> 09:56.700
There's a sample exercise lesson. This is a format I use for instruction content for developers.

09:59.440 --> 10:07.810
You can see there are a few sample course summary options. And, some internal reference material that contains links to common documents our team uses

10:07.820 --> 10:15.870
including the QA content checklist, accessibility requirements and sample process guidelines. To add Shared Block Template content

10:15.870 --> 10:23.910
within a new lesson, select All Blocks >  Block Templates and then you search. I have created and shared a number of black templates

10:23.910 --> 10:26.660
with the S. B. T underscore (SBT_) prefix.

10:27.840 --> 10:32.280
For example, you may want to add the link to the Workday architecture map to your course.

10:33.240 --> 10:40.010
Another block template is the SBT_Sample Labeled Graphic Dev Tips - which is very similar to the interaction

10:40.010 --> 10:43.160
I used to build this tips and tricks course for you.

10:44.710 --> 10:50.430
I hope you found this demo helpful. Best wishes to you and I hope you share your tips and tricks with the learning community,

10:50.430 --> 10:52.360
too. Thanks for watching!
